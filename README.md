## üìã About The Project

Crisp is a fully client-side web application designed to help developers prepare for full-stack technical interviews. It provides a realistic, timed interview experience where questions are dynamically generated by an AI. Candidates can answer using a rich text editor, and all sessions are saved locally for review on a comprehensive dashboard.

This project was built from the ground up, starting with detailed system architecture (SysArch, ERD, DFD) and progressing through a phased, bottom-up implementation, including extensive debugging and feature polishing.

## ‚úÖ Project Goals & Requirements Status

This table explicitly details how each original project requirement was successfully implemented.

| Requirement | Implementation Status & Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Two Synced Tabs** | ‚úÖ **Met.** The application features an "Interviewee View" and a "Dashboard View" built with Ant Design Tabs. State is synchronized between them using a centralized Redux store. |
| **Resume Upload (PDF/DOCX)** | ‚úÖ **Met.** Candidates can upload a resume in `.pdf` or `.docx` format. Client-side parsing is handled by the `pdfjs-dist` and `mammoth.js` libraries. |
| **Extract & Confirm Details** | ‚úÖ **Met.** The system extracts the Name, Email, and Phone number from the resume. To handle both missing fields and parsing errors, a confirmation modal appears, allowing the user to verify or correct their details before the interview begins. |
| **Timed AI Interview** | ‚úÖ **Met.** The app runs a timed interview where the AI dynamically generates 6 questions (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard). The timer for each question (20s, 60s, 120s) is managed by a `useEffect` hook. |
| **Auto-Submit on Timeout** | ‚úÖ **Met.** When the timer for a question reaches zero, the currently typed text in the rich text editor is automatically submitted as the answer. If the editor is empty, a "(No answer provided)" message is sent. |
| **Dashboard with Search & Sort** | ‚úÖ **Met.** The dashboard shows a list of all candidates. It includes an input field to search by name and allows the list to be sorted by the final score. |
| **Detailed Candidate View** | ‚úÖ **Met.** Clicking on any candidate in the dashboard opens a detailed modal. This view shows the candidate's profile information, the final AI-generated summary, and a complete history of all questions, answers, and individual scores. |
| **Data Persistence** | ‚úÖ **Met.** All application state, including candidate records and in-progress interview details (timers, answers), is persisted in the browser's Local Storage using Redux Persist. |
| **Pause & Resume Session** | ‚úÖ **Met.** If the browser is refreshed during an interview, a "Welcome Back" modal appears on reload. This gives the user the option to continue the session exactly where they left off or to abort and start over. |


## ‚ú® Core Features

* **üìÑ Resume Parsing:** Upload a PDF or DOCX resume to automatically extract contact details.
* **‚úÖ Data Confirmation:** A user-friendly modal allows candidates to confirm or edit parsed details before starting.
* **ü§ñ AI-Powered Questions:** Dynamically generates 6 questions (Easy, Medium, Hard) for a React/Node.js role using the Google Gemini API.
* **‚è±Ô∏è Timed Responses:** Each question has a specific time limit (20s, 60s, 120s), with smart auto-submission of the current answer.
* **‚úçÔ∏è Rich Text Editor:** A modern Tiptap-based editor allows for formatted, multi-line answers with lists and styling.
* **üîÑ Session Persistence:** All progress is saved to local storage. Refreshing the page mid-interview triggers a "Welcome Back" modal to resume or abort the session.
* **üìä Review Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard lists all candidates, their scores, and AI-generated summaries. Clicking a candidate opens a detailed modal with the full Q&A history.
* **üì± Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive, providing an excellent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Design
The application is built on a modern, scalable foundation using the Flux pattern (via Redux) and a clear layered architecture. Key design patterns like Observer, Command, and a State Machine are used to ensure separation of concerns and maintainable code.

For a detailed breakdown of the architecture and visual diagrams, please see the Architecture Documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Front-End:** React 19, Vite
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist
* **UI Library:** Ant Design
* **Rich Text Editor:** Tiptap
* **AI Integration:** Google Gemini Pro via `@google/generative-ai`
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ringerH/crisp-ai-assistant.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd crisp-ai-assistant
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
    * Add your Google AI Studio API key:
        ```env
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YourSecretApiKeyGoesHere"
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## üåê Deployment

This project is deployed on **Vercel**. The deployment process is automated. The only manual step required is to add the `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` as an Environment Variable in the Vercel project settings to ensure the live application can access the AI service.
